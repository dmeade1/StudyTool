    "options": [],
    "subQuestions": [],
    "answer": null,
    "explanation": "Even if capital moved freely across national borders, MNCs would still exist, because MNCs bring a host of firm-specific knowledge and advantages along with capital to the countries in which they operate. Such advantages may include unique products, processes, technologies, patents, specific rights, or specific knowledge and skills. These advantages can be used profitably in foreign markets. Moreover, MNCs are better able to apply the knowledge and skills gained in their prior operations in other countries to each new country that they enter. Thus, from the point of view of a country attracting foreign capital, the capital that is brought in by an MNC brings with it firm-specific advantages that yield better returns than the capital that is simply borrowed from a foreign country.",

    "explanation": "Part a: Dollar depreciates against the euro. U.S. goods are now relatively more expensive compared to European goods. This decreases demand by Europeans for U.S. goods and decreases the demand for dollars... This also increases American's desire for imports... Both factors drive the exchange rate of €/$ downward.\nPart b: Dollar appreciates against the euro. U.S. securities now offer a relatively higher return... Europeans need more dollars and Americans need fewer euros. So the demand for dollars by Europeans increases... and the supply of dollars by Americans decreases...",
