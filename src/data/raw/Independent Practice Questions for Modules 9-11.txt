21-26. The following tables show currency quotes from three Banks. Note that this problem does NOT ask you to solve for arbitrage profit. The reason for this is to get extra practice on a challenging step in solving triangular arbitrage exercises. 
Each column of the table is a separate exercise. For each exercise answer the following three questions.
	•	Which bank offers the “Quoted Cross Rate?” (See notes and book for the definition of this term).
	•	Solve for the implied cross rate using the quotes provided. (See notes and book for the definition of this term). 
	•	Comparing the quoted cross rate and the implied cross rate, which currency do you want to buy, and which currency do you want to sell at the bank you identified in question A?

27-33. Refer to your answers to Exercises 21-26 above. Suppose a trader begins with $5,750,000 in each case. Solve for this trader’s triangular arbitrage profit in each case. Show each step in the arbitrage process.

34. Doug Bernard specializes in cross-rate arbitrage. He notices the following quotes:
Bank A: CHF/USD = CHF 1.5971/USD
Bank B: AUD/USD = AUD 1.8215/USD
Bank C: AUD/CHF = AUD 1.1440/CHF
Ignoring transaction costs, does Doug Bernard have an arbitrage opportunity based on these quotes? If there is an arbitrage opportunity, what steps would he take to make an arbitrage profit, and how much would he profit if he has $1,000,000 available for this purpose?

13. A. [(1.8360-1.8410)/1.8410]*[360/30] =  - 0.0326 = 3.26% discount      B. [(0.5519-0.5432)/0.5432]*[360/180] = .0320 = 3.2% premium 
14. Increasing
15. [(0.9032-0.8898)/0.8898]*[360/90] = 0.0602 = 6.02% premium
16. You need to determine the ask on the euro
Spot = $1.1244
F6 = $1.0912

[(1.0912 – 1.1244)/1.1244]*[360/180] = - 0.0591 = 5.91% discount

17. The quoted cross rate is €1.5000/£ at National Westminster.
Solve for an implied cross rate between the other two banks that you can compare to this.
($1.8500/£)*(€/$1.2400) = €1.4919/£.
The implied cross rate does not equal the quoted cross rate so arbitrage is possible.
Comparing the quoted and implied cross rates, you find that a pound buys more euros at National Westminster’s quoted cross rate.
So, your goal becomes to buy euros with pounds at National Westminster.
First you need pounds (since you’re starting with dollars)!
*	First, buy pounds at Citibank: £540,540.50
*	Second, buy euros at National Westminster: €810,810.81
*	Third, buy dollars at Deutsche Bank: $1,005,405.40. The result is a profit of $5,405.40.

18. 	The quoted cross rate at Bank J is:	CHF 0.016459 / ¥.
	Solve for an implied cross rate between the other two banks that you can compare to this.
	(CHF 1.7125 /$)*($0.009411/¥) = CHF 0.016163/¥
	Notice that a yen buys more francs at Bank J compared to the cross rate. 
	So, your goal becomes to buy francs with yen at Bank J.
	First you need yen (since you’re starting with dollars)!
	•	First, exchange $1,000,000 into ¥ 106,258,633.50 at Bank A.
	•	Second, exchange ¥ 106,258,633.50 into CHF 1,748,910.85 at Bank J.
	•	Third, exchange CHF 1,748,910.85 into $1,021,261.81 at Bank S.

19. This question is asking about the forward premium or discount on the Canadian dollar (in US dollars).
	F1= [(.9628 - .9629)/.9629] * (360/30) = -.0012 = 0.12% discount
	F3= [(.9624 - .9629)/.9629] * (360/90) = -.0021 = 0.21% discount
	F6= [(.9614 - .9629)/.9629] * (360/180) = -.0031 = 0.31% discount
The Canadian dollar sells forward at a discount that becomes deeper over time. The implication is that the Canadian dollar is expected to depreciate against the U.S. dollar.

20.  This question is asking about the forward premium or discount on the JPY (in USD). Solution: The formula we want to use is:




The pattern of forward premiums indicates that the Japanese yen is trading at a premium versus the U.S. dollar. That is, it becomes more expensive to buy a Japanese yen forward for U.S. dollars (in absolute and percentage terms) the further into the future one contracts.

31.  There are no arbitrage steps to take because the implied INR/CHF cross rate is identical to the quoted INR/CHF cross rate. The no-arbitrage condition is met (same price on the asset in both markets). 

32. Notice the quoted cross rate at Bank C is stated in terms of AUD/CHF. 
Cross-multiply to solve for the AUD to CHF implied cross rate between Banks A and B.
Implied cross rate = .

Yes, there is an arbitrage opportunity because the implied cross rate ≠ quoted cross rate.
Which currency does he want to buy at Bank C? He wants to buy Australian dollars and sell francs at Bank C (because he gets more AUD per CHF at Bank C’s quoted cross rate than he does through the implied cross rate).
Arbitrage transactions: First, buy CHF 1,5971,000 at Bank A.
Next, buy AUD 1,827,082 at Bank C.
Last, buy UAD 1,003,065 at Bank B.
Profit = $3,065.
