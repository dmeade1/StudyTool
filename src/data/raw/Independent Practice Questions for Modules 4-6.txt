ANSWERS

1.	a.	Since it is the Czech koruna that has depreciated, it is most convenient to place the koruna in the denominator of the foreign exchange quote; CZK36.02/$ = $0.02776/CZK. A 20% depreciation of the koruna results in: (End rate) = (Beg. rate)(1+%) = ($0.02776/CZK)(0.80) = $0.02221/CZK, or CZK45.03/$. 
	b.	To find the dollar appreciation, it is most convenient to use a CZK/$ quote. The dollar appreciates by (45.03-36.02)/36.02 = 25%
	•	
2.	d	explanation: On 8/22 the exchange rate required $1.89 to buy one British pound. On 8/29, $2.50 was required to buy one British pound. So the dollar depreciated against the pound. This is the same thing as saying the pound appreciated against the dollar.

3.	The large influx of foreigners into Britain increases the demand for British goods and services. So, in the market for British pounds there is an increase in demand for pounds. The demand curve shifts to the right and the equilibrium $/£ exchange rate increases.

4.	a.	U.S. goods are now relatively more expensive compared to European goods. This decreases demand by Europeans for U.S. goods and decreases the demand for dollars (shifts left to Da). This also increases American’s desire for imports, and therefore, increases the supply of dollars (shifts right to Sa). Both of these factors drive the exchange rate of €/$ downward. This means the dollar depreciates against the euro.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

                                                                             







b.	U.S. securities now offer a relatively higher return compared to euro-denominated securities. This means Europeans and Americans both desire to hold relatively more U.S. securities and less euro-denominated securities. This means Europeans need more dollars and Americans need fewer euros. So the demand for dollars  by Europeans increases (shifts right to Dc) and the supply of dollars by Americans decreases (shifts left to Sc).  The dollar appreciates against the euro.















5. 	a.	The U.S. dollar value of the Zim dollar prior to devaluation was $0.0099 (1/101). Subsequent to devaluation, the Zim dollar was worth $0.004 (1/250). 
	•	The U.S. dollar value of the Zim dollar has changed by (0.004 - 0.0099)/0.0099 = -59.6%. Thus, the Zim dollar has devalued by 59.6% against the U.S. dollar.
	•	147.5%

6. 	a.  The dollar value of the yen in 2002 was $0.008 (1/125). By 2006, the yen had risen to $0.0087.
			b.	Between 2002 and 2006, the yen rose by 8.8%, calculated as (0.0087 - 0.008)/0.008.
			c.	During this same period, the dollar depreciated by 8%, calculated as (115 - 125)/125.

7.  a. Since the euro is now worth more in dollar terms, it has appreciated against the dollar. The amount of euro appreciation is (1.3634 - 1.2966)/1.2966 = 5.15%.
b.  The flip side of euro appreciation is dollar depreciation. The dollar has depreciated by an amount equal to [(1/1.3634) – (1/1.2966)]/(1/1.2966)  =  -4.9%

8. a. The won devalued ($0.067-$0.465)/$0.465) = 98.56% 	b.  (0.005-0.0067)/0.0067 = 25.4%
9. a. The rupee devalued by (0.02298 - 0.02327)/0.02327, or -1.25%.   
b. The dollar appreciated against the rupee by  [(1/0.02298) - (1/0.02327)]/(1/0.02327), or 1.28%.

10.	a	
11. 	b

12.	b.	explanation: At an exchange rate below equilibrium, there is a shortage of yen, with Americans wanting more Japanese imports than the Japanese want to export. The price of yen is thus bid up to equilibrium. See explanation and graph given in class.
13.	 e.	explanation: If the price level in Mexico falls relative to the U.S. then Mexican imports become more attractive to Americans and they demand more pesos (which means the supply of dollars increases). At the same time, American exports become relatively more expensive to Mexicans and they demand fewer dollars (supply of pesos decreases).
14. a.	explanation: An appreciation in the U.S. dollar means it takes more of other countries’ currencies to buy a dollar. This means that the price of American exports increases, which decreases the amount of the U.S. exports abroad
15.  a	
16.  b.   (105 -80)/80 = 31.25%
17. False- in 2011 the Swiss National Bank (SNB) intervened in the currency market to strengthen the euro because Swiss exports were declining.
