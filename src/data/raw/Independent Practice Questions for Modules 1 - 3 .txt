4. Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) quotes the following rates for the U.S. dollar (note: forward rates are just rates contracted for an exchange in the future, whereas the spot rate is a rate on a given day and the question is focusing on converting bid and ask rates on different currencies).
	•	
				Bid (€/$)	Ask (€/$)
			Spot rate	0.8894	0.8898
			1-month forward	0.8938	0.8942
			3-month forward	0.9028	0.9032
			6-month forward	0.9164	0.9168
			12-month forward	0.9443	0.9447

	Convert these to $/€ quotes for the euro—be careful with your bid and ask labels!

Answers
1.		False. The multinational financial manager is likely to require knowledge of several fields within finance.
2. 	On 8/22, the exchange rate on the British pound was $1.89/£

3. 	Traders buy low and sell high, but don’t necessarily state everything in terms of “Rule #2”. This question requires that you keep bids and asks constant as bids and asks but deduce which currency is being bought or sold.  Restating in terms of “Rule #2” is a good way to evaluate.
		a.      €0.8894/$ Bid and €0.8898/$ Ask. The amount of euros bid for dollars is lower and asked for dollars is higher so the currency CSFB is buying at the bid and selling at the ask is the dollar.
	•	€0.8898/$ Bid and €0.8894/$ Ask. The amount of euros to dollars in the bid is higher than in the ask price so CSFB. This must be a bid on the euro and an ask on the euro. Apply Rule #2 to check. The bid is $1.238/ € and the ask is $1.244/ €. Thus the trader is buying euros low at $1.238 and selling euros high at $1.244.

4.					€ Bid in $/€ 		€ Ask in $/€	
		Spot rate	$1.1238		$1.1244 	
		1-month forward	$1.1183		$1.1188	
		3-month forward	$1.1072		$1.1077	
		6-month forward	$1.0908		$1.0912	
		12-month forward	$1.0585		$1.0590	
	•	
	
	CSFB is buying dollars at their dollar bid price, so you will receive (€0.9164/$) x ($10 million) = €9,164,000
	CSFB is selling euros and hence buying dollars. CSFB’s ask price on the euro is $1.05899/Є (bid price is $1.05854/Є). Therefore, you will pay $10,590,000 for 10 million euros.

5. The car costs 70,000/.7821 or $89,502.62
6. Even if capital moved freely across national borders, MNCs would still exist, because MNCs bring a host of firm-specific knowledge and advantages along with capital to the countries in which they operate. Such advantages may include unique products, processes, technologies, patents, specific rights, or specific knowledge and skills. These advantages can be used profitably in foreign markets. Moreover, MNCs are better able to apply the knowledge and skills gained in their prior operations in other countries to each new country that they enter. Thus, from the point of view of a country attracting foreign capital, the capital that is brought in by an MNC brings with it firm-specific advantages that yield better returns than the capital that is simply borrowed from a foreign country.

14. The advantages of the gold standard include: (I) since the supply of gold is restricted, countries cannot have high inflation; (2) any BOP disequilibrium can be corrected automatically through cross-border flows of gold. On the other hand, the main disadvantages of the gold standard are: (I) the world economy can be subject to deflationary pressure due to restricted supply of gold; (ii) the gold standard itself has no mechanism to enforce the rules of the game, and, as a result, countries may pursue economic policies (like de-monetization of gold) that are incompatible with the gold standard.
15. The main objectives of the Bretton Woods system were to achieve exchange rate stability and promote international trade and development.
16. 	Once capital markets are integrated internationally, vast amounts of money may flow in and out of a country in a short time period. This will make it very difficult for the country to maintain a fixed exchange rate.
